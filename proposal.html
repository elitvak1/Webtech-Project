<h1>Project Proposal</h3>
<h3>Emerson Litvak</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Website Topic:</h2>
<p>My website will review my favorite fantasy and sci-fi books categorized by the author. 
</p>
<h2>Objective and Target Audience:</h2>
<p>The target audience will be readers who are either new to the genre looking for a great book to start their epic journey through the genre; or experience readers of the genre looking for their next great fantasy sci-fi book.

</p>
<h2>Content:</h2>
<p>There will be a page for each author: Brandon Sanderson, Lev Grossman, V.E. Schwabb, and Patrick Rothfuss. Each page will include a author biography, summary of each book, goodreads ratings and comments. I will explain what makes them special among the others and why I enjoyed them. There will be images of book covers, authors, fan drawings of characters and iconic scenes or events. Really any data associated with the books and authors is in play. There will be links to goodreads for more info on the book (comments, review, ratings), a link to purchase it on Amazon, and a link to the biography of the author- whatever webpage has the best. There may be links to reddit pages. Content may change in scope as I developed the website. Format may change as well.
